# Example: Cross-Framework Components

An example app based on `piral-core`.

> Pilets are fetched dynamically. The available converters are demonstrated.

## Description

The sample shows the essential use of piral-core with a very simple layout and a variety of (integrated) pilets that use most of the core pilet API functions. Additionally, some of the available (opt-in) plugins are shown, such as piral-ng (Angular API) and piral-vue (Vue API).

There are no backend connections, however, to demonstrate lazy loading and other covenience factors effectively a bit of artificial delay here and there may have been added.

To show interaction between different frameworks extensions are used. Some links and simple interactivity are there to show the concepts.
